# About the project

I am very excited about this course. I think I will learn a lot of interesting and very useful things. I study statistics, so I want this course be a bit more practical that my other studies.

Johanna Tuhkanen recommended me this course. Also, I got a letter from Kimmo Vehkalahti advertising this course.
